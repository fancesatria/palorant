          <h3>Cyber City</h3>
          <p>
            A neon-lit metropolis with towering skyscrapers and bustling alleyways. The verticality and tight corners create 
            intense close-quarters combat, demanding quick reflexes and smart positioning. The streets pulse with life, the hum of hovercrafts and the flicker of holographic ads providing an electric backdrop 
            to the urban chaos. Every turn holds the potential for danger, making each step a calculated risk in a world that never sleeps.

            <p>
              A high-tech research facility nestled in the icy wilderness, featuring narrow corridors and open snowfields. 
              Players must navigate slippery surfaces and utilize both indoor and outdoor areas for strategic advantage. 
              The harsh, frozen landscape poses unique challenges, requiring quick thinking and adaptability to survive the freezing environment. 
              The constant threat of blizzards and rapidly dropping temperatures make movement unpredictable, while the treacherous terrain offers

            <h3>Jungle Kingdom</h3>
            <p>
              A dense, overgrown jungle with ancient ruins and hidden pathways. Players can use the thick foliage for cover while exploiting 
              strategic points within the ruins to outmaneuver opponents. The air is thick with humidity, and the sounds of wildlife echo through 
              the dense trees, adding an element of unpredictability to each encounter. The constant rustle of leaves and distant animal calls keep players on edge, while treacherous terrain and sudden weather changes make every step a calculated risk.

            <p>
              A sun-baked urban area surrounded by vast dunes, featuring open streets and crumbling buildings. 
              Long sightlines make it ideal for snipers, while the ruins provide numerous hiding spots and tactical 
              chokepoints. The intense desert heat and occasional dust storms add layers of unpredictability, forcing 
              players to stay alert and use the environment to their advantage while avoiding distant threats and ambushes.

            <p>
              A futuristic research station on the moonâ€™s surface, with low-gravity areas and interconnected labs. 
              The unique environment challenges players to adapt their movement and strategy in this otherworldly battleground. 
              The lack of atmosphere and unpredictable gravitational shifts make every movement feel weightless, forcing players 
              to rethink their combat tactics and navigation. Players must use the terrain and lab equipment to their advantage 
              while contending with the vast, desolate moon landscape outside.

              A sprawling underwater city filled with futuristic architecture and glowing marine life. The map features intricate tunnels, 
              glass walkways, and submerged plazas, offering both open combat zones and tight, tactical corridors for intense firefights. 
              The ever-present pressure of the deep sea and the eerie glow of marine creatures add to the atmosphere, making it a battleground like no other.
